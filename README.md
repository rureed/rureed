### Hello and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full Stack web devoper currently concentrating in Front End work which I am combining with my extensive history in front-line support, multimedia, and library science.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with a team on a job-finding site focusing on sharing resources and opportunities.

ðŸŒ± At the momemtn Iâ€™m taking a deeper dive into:
- React Native 
- pure Functional JS 
- the Linux Command Line.

âš¡ Fun fact: I once interviewed Dr. Joyce Brothers for a college newspaper.
